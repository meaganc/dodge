# Gameplay
* The Player will appear in the bottom of the screen. Your quest, if you choose to accept it, is to reach the river without being attacked by the enemy bugs. Enemies move at random speeds and start at random times and come from random locations, so watch out! Your hiding place may soon be targeted! To navigate, use the keyboard arrow keys. You can move both forward and backward, but keep in mind, you may not move off the board. You can earn an additional random amount of points for grabbing the blue gem, but this will only appear once during the game for a short, random period of time.

If you crash into an enemy while crossing the divide, if your current accumulated score is greater than 0, you will lose a point. It is not possible to have a negative score. Every time you encounter an enemy bug, a rock will appear. When you score a point, a heart will flash on the screen.
